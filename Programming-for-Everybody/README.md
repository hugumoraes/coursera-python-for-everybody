# Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)

### Chapter 1

- Write a program that uses a print statement to say `hello world`

### Chapter 2

- Write a program that uses input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them. Enter Sarah in the pop-up box when you are prompted so your output will match `Hello Sarah`

- Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to test the program (the pay should be `96.25`). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking or bad user data.
