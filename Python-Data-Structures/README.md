# Python Data Structures

### Chapter 6

1. Write code using find() and string slicing (see section 6.10) to extract the number at the end of the line below. Convert the extracted value to a floating point number and print it out. 

`text = "X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475"`

### Chapter 7

1. Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, and print the contents of the file in upper case. Use the file words.txt to produce the output below.

You can download the sample data at words.txt[http://www.py4e.com/code3/words.txt]

2. Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, looking for lines of the form:

`X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475`

Count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and compute the average of those values and produce an output as shown below. Do not use the sum() function or a variable named sum in your solution.
